Comment:	for the future sake of security it's necessary to encrypt all messages and passwords.
			When the database user_table is diclosured or revealed not only there is no chance to
			protect the current user, but also other users' plain data can be manipulated, however,
			encrypting passwords buy some times to be decrypted so that broadcasting an anouncement
			can aware users to make changes and then migrating to proper pool to avoid the disclosure!
